it is asking us an offset

here this code opens any funciton in the code by taking its address so we just need to give it the address of print_flag() fucntion

since we have to give offset and it does main-offset

main-offset should be equal to &print_flag()

(&main-offset)=&print_flag()

offset=(&main-&print_flag())

in any binary file the address change with every function (only pie files but most of them are pie)

but the difference btw the functions is constant

so lets calculate (&main-&print_flag())

to do that i am using gdb

main offest is: 0x00000000000011e1

print_flag offset is:0x0000000000001179

the difference is : 68

so thats is our answer
