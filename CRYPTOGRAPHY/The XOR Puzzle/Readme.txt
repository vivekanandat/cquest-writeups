This is a XOR Cipher challenge where you are provided with a cipher text file and a python program which performs XOR encryption.
So you have to write a decryption code and also you should find the key used in this.
I have given the decryption program in this directory and the key is "3".
run the decryption program by giving cipher text and the key as input you will get the flag:

cquest{X0r_C1ph3r_Enc4yp1ion}
