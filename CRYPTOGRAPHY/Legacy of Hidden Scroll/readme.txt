This column like pattern is called as Spartan cipher which is used in ancient days by writing it on a strip(column wise) of paper and read vertically.
So the flag is right in front of you and its not encrypted:

S	a	t	M	C	3	f	y	n
p	n	4	3	h	n	3	p	2
4	_	l	t	4	g	n	t	0
r	C	3	4	l	3	c	1	2
t	y	_	_	l	0	r	0	5


when you read/write it column wise like S p 4 r t  a n _  C y t a....so on you will get the flag and it is:

cquest{Sp4rtan_Cyt4l3_M3t4_Ch4ll3ng30f3ncrypt10n2025}
