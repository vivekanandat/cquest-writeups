Its very simple challenge, when you search for similar messages using google lens by uploading the provided "Rock.jpg" you will come to know about the name of the Rock as "Krishna's Butter Ball". Since I have asked the name of the rock (you may think "Krishna's Butter Ball" is the name i have given for flag), search for other names of the rock you will get "Vaan Irai Kal"  which means "Stone of the Sky God". There you go the flag is:
